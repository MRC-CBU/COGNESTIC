    "2.\tThe lower threshold sets the minimum sigificance that a voxel must meet in order to be visible. It should be set such that only likely true effects will be seen. You can kind of think of it as a filter that removes voxels where no effect is present. The upper is just used for visualization purposes. If you set it very close to the min, then all voxels will appear to be the same color. If you set it higher, then you can get some gradation due to the strength of the effect. So the min removes voxels without an effect and the max allows you to see how the strength of the effect varies across the brain. \n",
    "3.\tBlue represents a negative correlation (i.e. thickness decreases with age), red represents positive correlation (i.e. thickness increases with age). \n",
