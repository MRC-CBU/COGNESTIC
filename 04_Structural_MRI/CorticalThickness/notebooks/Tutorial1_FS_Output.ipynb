    "# Introduction to FreeSurfer Output\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes text and images from the FreeSurfer tutorials. The full official FreeSurfer tutorials are available here: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to run the standard FreeSurfer pipeline using the command **recon-all**. You will also visualize and inspect correctly processed output data so that you can become familiar with what the end product should look like. The tutorial will take you through a variety of outputs, but is not necessarily the recommended procedure to take when trying to verify each subject for a real study. Some outputs are only necessary to check when troubleshooting, for example. However, it is a good idea for new users to become familiar with the variety of outputs and how to view them. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Set up a terminal window\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal windown and set up the SUBJECTS_DIR environment variable by using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "**export SUBJECTS_DIR=/home/cognestic/COGNESTIC/04_Structural_MRI/CorticalThickness/sample_data/FS_SUBJECTS_DIR**\n",
    "\n",
    "And now change directory to the COGNESTIC tutotial data folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "**cd $SUBJECTS_DIR**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running recon-all\n",
    "\n",
    "FreeSurfer is typically run from the command line, where users execute its tools using terminal commands such as **recon-all**. This approach provides flexibility for processing individual subjects or batch jobs via shell scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, FreeSurfer commands can also be executed from within a python script using the subprocess module. This allows users to automate and integrate FreeSurfer processing into broader Python-based pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Running recon-all\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the cell bellow, which shows you an example of how to run recon-all from within a python environment.\n",
    "2. Go to the terminal window you set up earlier, and check the FreeSurfer output folder has been created.\n",
    "3. As discussed earlier, recon-all takes several hours to run. Before you move on, please stop this cell from running. For the next steps, we'll use pre-prepared data instead.\n"

The green regions are gyri and the red regions are sulci. With this surface, the sulci are mostly hidden. Feel free to move the inflated brain around by left clicking on it and dragging the mouse.

The inflated surface can be helpful to find bumps, holes, or other defects that may need to be corrected.

Click on a color and view the name of the cortical region in the **Cursor** or **Mouse** windows next to where it says **aparc.annot**. Rotate the brain so you are looking at the medial wall. Notice that all subcortical gray matter is not a part of the surface labels (because those areas do not count towards the cortical surface measures). \n",
