Instead we will create these files by hand. Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found here:\n",

    "1.\tEnter the data for your design matrix, contrasts, or F-tests, using your data-editing tool of choice (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google docs, Notepad). \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tSave your data as a plain text file, with columns separated by spaces or tabs - in Excel, saving your file as Text (Tab delimited) should do the trick. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tUse the Text2Vest tool, to convert the data into the format used by FSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 1 and 2 have already been performed for you, and you can find the text files together with the data you downloaded: design_Age.txt and contrasts_Age.txt. Thereefore all we have to do is set up and run the Text2Vest commands: \n"
