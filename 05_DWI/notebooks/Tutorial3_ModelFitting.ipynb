    "## Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### DTI Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model: DTI is based on a model that assumes water diffusion follows a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tensor: It characterizes diffusion using a 3x3 symmetric tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parameters: The main parameters derived from DTI are:\n",
    "    * Fractional Anisotropy (FA): Measures the degree of anisotropy of water diffusion.\n",
    "    * Mean Diffusivity (MD): Average diffusivity within a voxel.\n",
    "    * Axial Diffusivity (AD): Diffusivity along the principal axis.\n",
    "    * Radial Diffusivity (RD): Average diffusivity perpendicular to the principal axis.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applications: DTI is widely used to map white matter tracts, study brain connectivity, and investigate diseases affecting white matter integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assumption of Gaussian Diffusion: DTI assumes that water diffusion follows a Gaussian distribution. This assumption is often violated in complex tissues where diffusion is restricted or hindered by cellular structures like membranes and fibers, leading to inaccuracies in regions with complex microstructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assumption of a single white matter (WM) fibre per voxel: The single-tensor model used in DTI may not accurately represent regions with crossing, kissing, or branching fibres. In such areas, the diffusion process is more complex, and the single-tensor model cannot capture the multiple directions of water diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limited Sensitivity to Microstructural Changes: DTI parameters like FA and MD provide limited information about the underlying tissue microstructure. They may not detect subtle changes or differentiate between different types of tissue alterations (e.g., DTI cannot differentiate neurodegeneration from demyelination).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Challenges with Interpretation: Interpreting DTI metrics can be challenging, as changes in FA or MD can result from various factors, such as changes in fiber density, myelination, axonal diameter, or the presence of oedema. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of observed changes in diffusion metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### DTI model fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we are working with comprises of three b-values per dataset: b=0, b=1000 and b=2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. The diffusion tensor model is not accurate for b-values greater than approximately 1300 s/mm<sup>2</sup> (see Jones et al, 2004, https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.20283) and therefore for the next steps we will include only the data acquired with b=0 and 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>.

    "\n",
    "* Model: DKI extends the DTI model by accounting for non-Gaussian diffusion. It includes an additional term that describes the kurtosis of the diffusion signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tensor: DKI uses both the diffusion tensor and a kurtosis tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parameters: In addition to DTI parameters, DKI provides:\n",
    "    * Mean Kurtosis (MK): A measure of the overall deviation from Gaussian diffusion.\n",
    "    * Axial Kurtosis (AK): Kurtosis along the principal axis of diffusion.\n",
    "    * Radial Kurtosis (RK): Kurtosis perpendicular to the principal axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applications: DKI provides more detailed information about tissue microstructure, useful for studying areas where diffusion is highly restricted or heterogeneous, such as in gray matter or in the presence of pathology like tumors or ischemic lesions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages relative to DTI:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sensitivity to Microstructural Changes: DKI can detect subtle changes in tissue microstructure that may not be visible with DTI.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Non-Gaussian Diffusion: By modeling non-Gaussian diffusion, DKI provides more accurate information about complex tissues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increased Complexity and Acquisition Time: DKI requires more diffusion gradient directions and higher b-values, leading to longer scan times and increased sensitivity to motion artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increased Noise in Kurtosis Estimates: The higher b-values required for DKI result in images with lower Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). This can lead to higher variability and inaccuracies in the estimation of kurtosis metrics. Since DKI involves fitting a more complex model to the diffusion-weighted data, noise can significantly affect the stability and reliability of the kurtosis parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Artefacts and Outliers: Noise can introduce artifacts and outliers in the diffusion-weighted images, which can propagate through the DKI pipeline, resulting in erroneous kurtosis maps. These artefacts can also obscure true biological variations.\n",

    "* Higher Computational Demands: The processing and analysis of DKI data are more computationally intensive compared to DTI.\n",
