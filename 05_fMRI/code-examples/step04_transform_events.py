# This script edits events.tsv files acquired from the OpenNeuro dataset. 
# In the OpenNeuro dataset, there are only three conditions: FAMOUS, UNFAMILIAR, and SCRAMBLED.
# Here we split each condition into three events: 
# _1 (first presentation), _2im (second immediate presentation), and _2dl (second delayed presentation).
