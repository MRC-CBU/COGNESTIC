    "# fMRI Data Analysis: Subject-Level Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data have been pre-processed, we can proceed to the analysis. In this tutorial, we will focus on subject-level (or first-level) fMRI data analysis using [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html). This process involves constructing a design matrix, fitting the model to the data, and computing beta maps (i.e., the estimated response for each condition) or contrast maps. Subject-level analysis is a crucial step before progressing to group-level analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For analysing fMRI data, we commonly use general linear model (GLM). A GLM in fMRI analysis has the **BOLD signal** as the **outcome** variable (derived from the pre-processed functional MRI images) and **predictor** variables such as **events** (e.g., task conditions) and **confounds** (e.g., motion parameters). Typically analysis is performed by constructing a separate model for each voxel - **a mass univariate approach**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on GLM, please see [Rik's Stats tutorial](../02_Statistics/cognestic_stats_python.ipynb) (corresponding [web link](https://github.com/MRC-CBU/COGNESTIC/tree/main/02_Statistics)).\n",

    "* **The design matrix (X)**, where we specify the effects (predictors) that may have influenced the acquired signal in the data. At a minimum, these effects include our experimental conditions, which we specify through event files containing the names and onsets of the conditions. Additionally, we can include other predictors, such as confounding (nuisance) variables, which are known to have occurred and likely influenced the data. Including these can help explain the acquired signal. We get a large list of confounding variables from the fMRIPrep output (confound files). The size of the design matrix must be n x p (time series length x number of predictors). There should be more data points (n) than predictors (p), so be cautious not to include too many confounding variables.\n",

    "A contrast is a linear combination of the beta estimates that allows us to test specific hypotheses about the experimental conditions. Each condition or regressor in the model is assigned a weight in the contrast, and these weights are combined to produce a contrast estimate.\n",

    "For example, to **compare two conditions** and test whether the mean activation in Condition A is greater than in Condition B, the contrast vector would be `c = [1, -1, 0, ...]`. Here, the 1 corresponds to Condition A, and the -1 corresponds to Condition B, indicating that we are comparing the two conditions. Zeros correspond to other conditions or regressors that are not part of the contrast. The resulting contrast estimate tests the difference between the beta estimates for these two conditions.\n",

    "You can also test **combinations of conditions** by assigning equal weights to multiple conditions. For example, to test whether the mean activation across two conditions (A and B) is greater than that in a third condition (C), the contrast vector would be `[0.5, 0.5, -1, 0, ...]`. This reflects an average of Conditions A and B compared to Condition C.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in testing **the effect of a single condition** against the baseline, the contrast would be `[1, 0, 0, ...]`, where the 1 refers to the condition of interest, and the zeros correspond to other conditions or regressors that are not part of the contrast.\n",

    "An **effects of interest** contrast is often used to assess the overall impact of all conditions or predictors of interest in the model. For effects of interest, a matrix-type contrast is used. This allows testing whether all conditions of interest, taken together, explain a significant amount of variance in the data. For example, if you have three conditions (A, B, C) and want to test whether they collectively explain significant variance, your matrix-type contrast would be:\n",

    "As mentioned earlier, a GLM contrast is a linear combination of predictor beta coefficients, where each beta represents the weight or contribution of a given predictor to the overall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have conditions (predictors): Famous, Unfamiliar, and Scrambled, a contrast estimating Faces vs. Scrambled with weights `[1, 1, -2]` would calculate Famous + Unfamiliar - 2 * Scrambled. This can be interpreted as the sum of the responses to Famous and Unfamiliar faces, minus twice the response to Scrambled faces. However, what we typically want is the average response to Famous and Unfamiliar faces minus the response to Scrambled faces. To achieve this, we would need to scale the contrast as follows: `[0.5, 0.5, -1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling contrast weights affects the magnitude of the resulting contrast estimate, but not the t-values or p-values, so the statistical inference remains unchanged. However, contrast estimates that reflect averages rather than sums are generally more meaningful for interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to obtain beta estimates for each condition separately (e.g., a beta estimate for Famous, a beta estimate for Unfamiliar, etc.), and we have multiple functional runs, we need to scale the contrast to account for the number of runs to get the average beta across them. When scaled appropriately, we can report the result as a *'beta estimate'* rather than just a *'contrast estimate'*, since scaling allows the contrast to represent the average of the beta estimates. This average can then be interpreted directly as a beta estimate for the condition."

    "In Nilearn, Bonferroni correction is applied to the number of voxels. The Bonferroni correction, when applied directly to the number of voxels, is not appropriate for fMRI data. This is because neuroimaging data typically have spatially correlated data points, which violate the Bonferroni assumption of independent tests. As an alternative, neuroscientists have developed **Random Field Theory** (RFT). This method accounts for the spatial correlation by applying multiple comparison correction in a way that considers the smoothness of the data. Specifically, the correction is applied to the number of '***resels'*** (RESolution ELements), rather than the raw number of voxels. However, it's important to note that this **RFT-based approach is not implemented in Nilearn**. \n",

    "#### **Using `SLURM`**\n",
    "  \n",
    "If `SLURM `is available on the system, you can create a project-specific script where you define the paths and use the `sbatch` command to execute the generic script for each subject in parallel using.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example script**: [step08_first_level_analysis.sh](code-examples/step08_first_level_analysis.sh)\n",
    "\n",
    "If `SLURM` is not available, you can still process multiple subjects in parallel using alternative methods depending on the system you're working with.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Using Python's `multiprocessing` Module**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Python's `multiprocessing` module allows you to run processes in parallel on your local machine, distributing the workload across multiple CPU cores. An advantage is that it can be run on a single machine without needing a cluster or SLURM. A disatvantage is that it is limited by the local resources (RAM, CPU), and not ideal for very large datasets or many subjects.\n",
    "Here is an example how you could use the `multiprocessing` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing as mp\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a function to process a single subject\n",
    "def process_subject(subject_id, dataset_location, output_dir):\n",
    "    # Execute the first-level script with the appropriate arguments\n",
    "    os.system(f\"python first_level_script.py {dataset_location} sub-{subject_id} {output_dir}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the dataset location and output directory\n",
    "dataset_location = \"/path/to/bids_dataset\"\n",
    "output_dir = \"/path/to/output\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of subject IDs\n",
    "subjects = ['01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16']\n",
    "# subjects = [f\"{i:02d}\" for i in range(1, 17)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a pool of processes using the available CPU cores\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    pool = mp.Pool(mp.cpu_count())  # Use all available CPU cores\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Use pool.starmap to pass multiple arguments to the process_subject function\n",
    "    pool.starmap(process_subject, [(subject, dataset_location, output_dir) for subject in subjects])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Close the pool and wait for the processes to complete\n",
    "    pool.close()\n",
    "    pool.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using Cloud Services**\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you don’t have SLURM or a powerful local machine, cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) allow you to run parallel processes with scalable resources. You can set up virtual machines or use a service like AWS Batch or Google Cloud Dataflow to handle parallel jobs across multiple subjects. However, it requires cloud expertise and comes with costs."
